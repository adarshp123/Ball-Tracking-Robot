Overview

This project involves creating a ball-tracking robot that uses a camera to detect and follow a yellow ball. The system is powered by a Jetson Nano, which processes the video feed and sends control signals to an Arduino that manages the motor movements. An ultrasonic sensor is integrated to stop the robot when it gets too close to the ball.

Components

Jetson Nano: A powerful edge AI device that handles image processing and decision making.
Arduino: A microcontroller that receives commands from the Jetson Nano and controls the motors and sensors.
Camera: A USB or CSI camera connected to the Jetson Nano for capturing real-time video.
Motors: DC motors with motor drivers controlled by the Arduino to move the robot.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Used to measure the distance to the ball and stop the robot when it's too close.
Power Supply: Appropriate power sources for the Jetson Nano, Arduino, and motors.
Functionality
Video Capture and Processing: The Jetson Nano captures video through the camera, processes the frames to detect a yellow ball using OpenCV, and identifies the ball's position and size.
Motor Control: Based on the ball's position, the Jetson Nano sends commands to the Arduino to adjust the motor speeds, ensuring the robot follows the ball.
Safety Stop: The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to the ball. If the ball is within a predefined safe distance (e.g., 10 cm), the Arduino stops the motors to prevent collision.
Real-Time Visualization: The processed video is displayed with the detected ball highlighted, providing visual feedback for debugging and demonstration.
Detailed Steps

Setup and Configuration:

Connect the camera to the Jetson Nano.
Connect the motors and motor driver to the Arduino.
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino.
Establish serial communication between the Jetson Nano and the Arduino.

Jetson Nano Code:

Initialize the camera and set up video capture.
Use OpenCV to process the video frames and detect the yellow ball.
Calculate the error based on the ball's position relative to the center of the frame.
Send motor control commands to the Arduino based on the calculated error.
Display the video with the detected ball highlighted.

Arduino Code:

Receive motor control commands from the Jetson Nano via serial communication.
Control the motor speeds using PWM signals.
Continuously read the distance from the ultrasonic sensor.
Stop the motors if the distance to the ball is less than the predefined threshold.

Testing and Calibration:

Calibrate the camera and ultrasonic sensor for accurate detection and distance measurement.
Test the robot's responsiveness to the ball's movement.
Adjust the PID controller parameters for smooth and accurate tracking.

Applications

Entertainment: Can be used as an interactive toy that follows a ball.
Prototyping: A base platform for developing more advanced autonomous robots.
Challenges and Considerations
Lighting Conditions: The ball detection performance may vary with different lighting conditions. Proper lighting setup is crucial.
Power Management: Ensuring a stable power supply to the Jetson Nano, Arduino, and motors is critical for consistent performance.
Real-Time Processing: Efficient processing of video frames to ensure real-time responsiveness of the robot.
